# Curriculum
This is an HTML and CSS web development project taken from [Kevin Powell's online course] (https://scrimba.com/learn/portfolio).  It is about setting up a dynamic and responsive website where we will present our portfolio, i.e., our simple and personalized curriculum vitae.  It is also possible to deploy it on Heruko, AWS or DigitalOcean.
